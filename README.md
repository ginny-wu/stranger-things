# stranger-things (2017)

## Background ##
I was inspired to play around with an Arduino after participating in a project to build a quadcopter with the device.
As I was hosting a Halloween get-together, I decided to try to replicate the blinking lights in the TV series Stranger Things.

## Approach ##
I found online that others had done this before already, so I replicated someone else's code and changed it to my needs. 
I had never used an Arduino before, so this was an introductory project for me.

## Outcome ##
